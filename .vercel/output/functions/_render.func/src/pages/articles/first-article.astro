    <h2>Bringing Change to the Community</h2>
    <p>
      STIE Dwimulya is committed to making a tangible difference in the local community through its Kuliah Kerja Mahasiswa (KKM) program. This initiative allows students to apply their academic knowledge to real-world challenges, working directly with local Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (UMKM) to help them grow and thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the recent KKM cycle, students partnered with UMKM in several key areas, providing assistance with business planning, financial management, digital marketing strategies, and product development. The hands-on experience gained by students is invaluable, while the UMKM benefit from fresh perspectives and practical support.
    </p>
    <h3>Success Stories</h3>
    <p>
      We've seen remarkable success stories emerge from the KKM program. For example, a small handicraft business in Serang saw a significant increase in sales after implementing digital marketing techniques recommended by STIE Dwimulya students. Another food vendor improved their financial record-keeping, leading to better cost management.
    </p>
    <p>
      These examples highlight the 'kampus perubahan' spirit of STIE Dwimulya, demonstrating our dedication to not just educating students but also contributing to the economic development of Banten.
    </p>
